# 🚀 My React Native Journey

Welcome to my React Native learning journey!  
This repository is where I explore, experiment, and document everything I learn about **React Native** — from the basics to more advanced concepts.

---

## 📘 About This Repo
This repo serves as a personal learning space.  
I’ll be:
- Building small projects and UI components 🧩  
- Trying out different libraries and tools ⚙️  
- Writing notes or explanations to help me (and maybe others) understand concepts better ✍️  

As I learn more, I might **rename** or **restructure** the repo to reflect my growth and understanding of React Native.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Currently Learning
- React Native fundamentals (components, props, state)
- Navigation and routing
- Handling assets (images, icons, fonts)
- Styling with `StyleSheet` and Tailwind (if used)
- TypeScript in React Native

---

## 🔮 Future Plans
I plan to:
- Build a few mini-projects (like a profile page, todo app, or shopping cart)
- Experiment with animations
- Learn about native modules and platform APIs
- Explore deployment to Android and iOS

---

## 💡 Why I Made This
I believe the best way to learn is by **building**.  
This repo is my sandbox — a place where I can make mistakes, learn, and share my progress.

---

## 🧭 Notes
This repository is always evolving —  
Expect name changes, folder reorganizations, and random experiments 😄

### ⚡ Tech Stack
- React Native  
- TypeScript  
- (and whatever I discover next 👀)
